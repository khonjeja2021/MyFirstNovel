Chapter 1

	We meet Nick, Tom

For me, I belong to a fair number of groups. We have a group of staff and academics 
developing this MicroMasters program, and we call ourselves the “BusLead team”, 
although this overlaps with the larger “UQx team”. I also head the Management 
Discipline at UQ Business School… but we call ourselves a “group” or a “cluster”, not a team. 
I also sit on a number of school committees -- groups organized to achieve particular decision-making or 
strategic objectives. And I maintain other, less formal group memberships across the university.
